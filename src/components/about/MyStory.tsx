                    Hey there again! You probably know my name by now, but I’m Ikechukwu Egwim. I’m a Computer Science graduate and frontend developer obsessed with crafting smooth, interactive digital experiences. I love solving tricky problems and turning messy code into something elegant and efficient.

                <p className='text-lg leading-8 mt-4'>
                    Professionally, I build web and mobile apps using <strong>React, Next.js, and Node.js</strong>. From designing responsive interfaces to integrating APIs, I thrive on projects that challenge me to think creatively and code thoughtfully.

                            My journey into tech began in 2019, right after finishing high school. Back then, I had no experience and didn’t even own a laptop. My first job as a computer operator taught me basic Microsoft tools and a bit of graphic design, but everything changed when my cousin gave me her old laptop and introduced me to coding. I started with Python, learning the basics, but soon discovered a YouTube tutorial on building simple web pages with HTML and CSS—and I was hooked.

                            Post-COVID, I gained admission into university to study Computer Science, completed two internships, and I’m currently enrolled in a mobile development training program at Rise. Every challenge taught me something new, and I continue to push myself to grow and improve every day.

                            Fun fact: I’m not very social and usually get tired after a few hours of hanging out. I can play a bit of drums and keyboard, and I find random songs in other languages surprisingly interesting!
